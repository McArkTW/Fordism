# The Fordism agent image for deepagents — the shared base plus this one CLI.
#
# Workspace: $WS/.deepagents
#   Everything this tool reads and writes is under /workspace, which is host-mounted and
#   kept. Nothing goes to /tmp: with one image per tool nothing collides over $HOME.
# Bedrock: the profile's URL and key, as an ordinary Anthropic endpoint
#
# ARG BASE lets CI pin the base tag it just built.
